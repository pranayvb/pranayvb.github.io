## ENPM691 - Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries

* Learned fundamentals of secure C programming practices and principles
* Gained skills in performing security attacks like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities
* Developed expertise in debugging C programs, understood memory management and “under the hood” programs.
* Learned machine language and assembly representations of C code and compilation stages
* Analyzed C programs to identify memory corruption bugs, validate input data, and remediate issues
* Understood how to exploit vulnerabilities in C programs by redirecting control flow, injecting payloads

## ENPM665 - Cloud Security

* Learned fundamentals of securing IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS cloud models
* Gained skills in designing and redesigning secure cloud applications
* Developed expertise in cloud identity and access management (IAM)
* Learned data protection techniques - encryption, access controls, network/host defenses
* Understood Amazon Web Services security capabilities for IAM, VPCs, storage, auditing
* Learned Microsoft Azure security - KeyVault, RBAC access controls, Policies, Monitoring
* Developed understanding of cloud incident response, forensics, vulnerability management
* Learned compliance considerations for major cloud environments - risk assessments

## ENPM694 - Networks and Protocols

* Understood data link layer concepts - error detection/correction, media access control, addressing, switches
* Learned network layer concepts - logical addressing, routing, IP protocol, ICMP
* Gained knowledge of transport layer protocols - TCP/UDP and session layer for communication sessions
* Learned wireless networking with 802.11, LTE, mobile IP, handling mobility
* Gained abilities in TCP/IP analysis, infrastructure hardening, VPNs, encryption
* Developed skills in firewalls, Wireshark packet analysis and inspection, advanced persistent threats
* Learned common routing algorithms like link-state, distance vector, hierarchical routing

To conclude, during the first fall semester, I acquired a diverse range of cybersecurity skills across three courses. In ENPM691 - Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries, I learned secure C programming practices, vulnerability identification, and debugging techniques. ENPM665 - Cloud Security provided me with a solid foundation in securing cloud infrastructures and managing cloud identities. Lastly, in ENPM694 - Networks and Protocols, I gained insights into network layers, routing algorithms, and practical skills in TCP/IP analysis. This semester was instrumental in building a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity principles, spanning secure coding practices, cloud security, and network protocols.
