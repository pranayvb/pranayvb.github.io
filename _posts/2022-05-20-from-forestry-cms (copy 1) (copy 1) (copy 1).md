**1. Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment & Pen testing:**
*	As the project deliverable for ENPM665 - Cloud Security course, I led a team of three members in performing a comprehensive assessment of the organization's cloud infrastructure, specifically focusing on a vulnerable healthcare provider's AWS environment.
*	Performed the identification and analysis of potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within the AWS cloud infrastructure, leveraging a range of techniques and tools.
*	Conducted penetration testing exercises targeting cloud-based applications, APIs, storage systems, and networking configurations to simulate real-world attack scenarios and assess the effectiveness of existing security controls.
*	Delivered detailed vulnerability assessment reports, prioritizing risks based on severity, impact, and likelihood, to assist stakeholders in prioritizing remediation efforts and strengthening the cloud security posture.


**2. Network Scanner:**
*	Developed a custom network scanning tool using Python scripting on Kali Linux, leveraging libraries such as Scapy and Nmap to automate the discovery and analysis of available networks.
*	Incorporated advanced features such as host discovery, port scanning, service identification, and OS fingerprinting to provide comprehensive network reconnaissance capabilities.
*	Enhanced efficiency and flexibility by designing a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and customization of scanning parameters.
*	Achieved a significant reduction in reliance on third-party open-source network scanning tools by optimizing the tool's performance and tailoring it to specific project requirements.


**3. Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT):**
*	Conducted a thorough examination of the target website to identify potential security vulnerabilities, utilizing a combination of manual inspection and automated scanning tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.
*	Systematically categorized and documented discovered vulnerabilities, including their severity, impact, and recommended remediation strategies, in a detailed report format adhering to industry standards such as CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
*	Executed an efficient penetration testing methodology, encompassing reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation phases, to evaluate the website's resilience against real-world cyber threats.
*	Generated a comprehensive VAPT report containing findings, recommendations, and actionable insights for stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making and proactive risk mitigation measures.


**4. Cryptographic Android App:**
*	Conceptualized and developed an innovative Android application aimed at ensuring secure communication by enabling users to encrypt and decrypt messages using diverse cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).
*	Implemented robust encryption and decryption functionalities within the app, employing industry-standard cryptographic libraries and techniques to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of user data.
*	Conducted rigorous testing and evaluation procedures, including hash-cracking tests and performance benchmarking, to assess the efficacy and efficiency of different cryptographic algorithms under varying scenarios and workloads.
*	Utilized user feedback and analytical insights to refine the app's design, functionality, and algorithm selection, ensuring optimal usability and security for end-users across diverse use cases and environments.
