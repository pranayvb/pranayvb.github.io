## Introduction

I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity. I recently completed my 1st fall semester, achieving an excellent 3.73 GPA. I took interesting subjects like hacking of C programs and Unix binaries, network protocols and cloud security. Before joining UMD, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai in May 2023. With a profound interest in cybersecurity, I devote significant time to honing my skills and learning new competencies in this field. My enthusiasm also extends to cloud security, with a focus on Azure technologies. I am actively seeking a summer 2024 internship opportunity in cybersecurity, where I can apply my knowledge, enhance my skills, and contribute to impactful projects. If you have any relevant openings or insights to share, I welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss further.

## Curriculum i studied

During my first fall semester, I delved into three pivotal areas of cybersecurity:
Network Protocols:
•	Explored data link layer concepts such as error detection, media access control, and addressing.
•	Studied network layer topics like logical addressing, routing, and IP protocol.
•	Learned about transport layer protocols TCP/UDP and session layer communication sessions.
•	Developed proficiency in wireless networking with 802.11, LTE, and mobile IP.
•	Acquired skills in TCP/IP analysis, infrastructure hardening, VPNs, and encryption.
•	Delved into firewalls, Wireshark packet analysis, and advanced persistent threats.
•	Studied common routing algorithms including link-state, distance vector, and hierarchical routing.
Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries:
•	Mastered secure C programming practices and principles.
•	Learned techniques for security attacks like buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.
•	Developed expertise in debugging C programs and understanding memory management.
•	Explored machine language and assembly representations of C code.
•	Analyzed C programs to identify and remediate memory corruption bugs.
•	Explored exploitation of vulnerabilities in C programs by controlling flow and injecting payloads.
Cloud Security:
•	Acquired fundamentals of securing IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS cloud models.
•	Learned to design and redesign secure cloud applications.
•	Developed expertise in cloud identity and access management (IAM).
•	Studied data protection techniques including encryption and access controls.
•	Explored Amazon Web Services security capabilities and Microsoft Azure security features.
•	Gained insight into cloud incident response, forensics, and vulnerability management.
•	Examined compliance considerations for major cloud environments and conducted risk assessments.
These courses equipped me with advanced skills in architecting secure networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing robust cloud security measures.
