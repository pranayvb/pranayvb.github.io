I'm Pranay Venkata Bhamidipati, and I have a keen interest in Cybersecurity, primarily in red teaming, but I am expanding my knowledge by diving into blue teaming as well.

Currently, I am a Graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park (Fall 2023 to Spring 2025), where I am pursuing a Masters of Engineering in Cybersecurity (M.Eng Cybersecurity). I successfully completed my first semester with an excellent GPA of 3.73 out of 4.0. During this semester, I gained a comprehensive understanding of diverse and in-depth security concepts through challenging and interesting courses such as ENPM691 - Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries, ENPM665 - Cloud Security, and ENPM694 - Networks and Protocols.

I'm actively seeking summer 2024 internships in the US and eager to connect with security professionals and recruiters.
